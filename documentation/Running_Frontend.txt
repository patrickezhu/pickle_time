1. Download Node.js if you do not have it.
    https://nodejs.org/
    If you do you should see node -v and npm -v return a number in your command prompt
    
2. Open the frontend folder in your console and run "npm install"
3. Then run "npm run dev" to start the frontend server and view at local link it gives.


For editing
Go to the source/app/ folder and edit the page.jsx file for the page you want to edit.
page.jsx in the app folder is the first page that will appear so this will be the home page.
The rest are under folders titled 'Report' and 'View'. The page.jsx file in each will correspond to each page.

For css just add it to the globals.css file in src/app/






The folder structure basically sets it so that hypothetically www.pickletime.com/ leads to the home page.

And www.pickletime.com/{folder name} leads to the page.jsx file for that respective folder.

so www.pickletime.com/Report will display the page.jsx file in the report folder.
